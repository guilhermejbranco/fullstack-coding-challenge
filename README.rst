# Unbabel Fullstack Challenge

When running the application for the first time, there are some database configurations needed.

Create a database with the name **unbabel_challenge** or change the variable **DB_NAME**
in the config.py file to the database you want to use.

Create a user with the name **postgres** and password **root**, or change the variable DB_USER
and DB_PW in the config.py file to the user and password you want to use.

After that, you're all set up!

## Run the application
`py app.py`

## Unit Testing

To execute a particular class of tests, run the following command:
`py -m unittest unittests.**CLASSNAME**`

To execute a test on all classes, run the following command:
`py unittests.py`

Thank you very much.
